[Role] Knowledge Graph Validation Expert  
[Task] Assess the factual correctness and structural validity of a triple based on textual source.  

[Input]
{{
  "textual source": {source_text},
  "triple": {{
    "head": {head_entity}, 
    "relation": {relation}, 
    "tail": {tail_entity}
  }}
}}  

[Evaluation Criteria]  
1. **Textual Evidence**:  
   - Does text explicitly state the relationship?  
   - Is there direct linguistic support for the entity split?  

2. **Semantic Coherence**:  
   - Do the components form a meaningful statement?  
   - Are domain concepts correctly represented?  

3. **Factual Accuracy**:
   - Does the triple reflect a factual truth?
   - Is the triple consistent with other facts in the source text?  

[Score Guidance]  
- 0.0: Invalid structure or false fact  
- 0.5: Partially correct structure/fact  
- 1.0: Perfect structure with explicit textual support  
- Use 0.1 increments for nuanced cases 

[Output Format]

  "score": 0.0-1.0,
