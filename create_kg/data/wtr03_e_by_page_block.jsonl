{"id": 5, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 2, "text": "The World Trade Report is a new annual publication produced by the WTO Secretariat. Each year, the WTR  will explore trends in world trade and highlight important issues in the world trading system. In addition  to monitoring and interpreting trade developments, the Report seeks to deepen public understanding  of pressing policy issues. The WTR does not pretend to provide comprehensive answers to complex and  many-sided questions subject to continuing debate among governments and their constituencies. Rather, by  explaining the origin of issues and offering an analytical framework within which to address them, the WTR  aims to contribute to more informed discussion and a better appreciation of the options available to address  policy challenges.", "paragraph_len": 755}
{"id": 6, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 3, "text": "Following a report on trends in world trade over the previous year and some observations about prospects  for the current year, WTR 2003 takes up three issues of topical interest in international trade. These are  developments in South-South trade, trends in non-oil commodity markets, and the growth of regional  trade agreements. In each case the Report analyses developments over the last few years, highlights their  implications, and draws a number of conclusions about the options facing governments.", "paragraph_len": 506}
{"id": 7, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 4, "text": "In the case of South-South trade, we see a marked expansionary trend, but one that is rather narrowly based  in regional terms. South-South trade clearly holds dynamic potential that could be realized more effectively  through further trade liberalization. This conclusion should in no way dilute focus on the need for continuing  liberalization efforts in respect of North-South trade, nor should it understate the need to develop the  necessary infrastructure and policy climate to facilitate South-South trade.", "paragraph_len": 513}
{"id": 8, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 5, "text": "The Report’s analysis of trends in non-oil commodity markets highlights the well-known fact that developing  countries economically reliant on basic commodities have suffered in recent years from price declines and  continuing volatility. A range of solutions are on offer to address this problem, but some of them have proven  less than effective in the past. Fresh thinking is needed, both on the question of what can be done in respect  of the commodity markets themselves, and how developing countries might diversify their economies away  from excessive reliance on a narrow production base. Trade liberalization has a role to play, particularly in the  areas of agriculture and tariff escalation.", "paragraph_len": 702}
{"id": 9, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 6, "text": "Regional trade agreements have burgeoned in the last decade or so. This can be good news and bad news.  Such agreements are good news when they bring regions closer together, create new profitable trading  opportunities and set the scene for more inclusive market-opening. They are bad news when they discriminate  unduly against third parties and frustrate the attainment of multilateral objectives built on non-discrimination.  No government has challenged the view that the multilateral trading system must retain its primary unifying  role at the core of trade relations among nations. Given this unity of purpose, governments need to do more  to ensure the coherence and compatibility of regional trading arrangements with the multilateral trading  system. This implies a strong commitment to advancing the multilateral agenda as well as ensuring that  regional agreements are designed to support and not to compete with the WTO system.", "paragraph_len": 941}
{"id": 10, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 7, "text": "The second section of the WTR addresses a broad range of issues that are of immediate and vital interest to  the membership of the WTO. This year’s theme is trade and development. Starting from a broad although  brief discussion of development and the relationship between trade and development, the Report goes on  to analyse how the Doha Development Agenda can contribute to growth and development in developing  countries.", "paragraph_len": 425}
{"id": 11, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 1, "text": "The Director-General of the WTO would never declare any year unimportant or unchallenging for the  trading system. But some years are undoubtedly more momentous than others, and this is one of them.  The Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancún in September is not the end of the Doha negotiations, but a very  important landmark on the road to completion. At Cancún, Ministers will have to take stock of progress in the  negotiations, provide political guidance and take certain decisions. This is not simply about meeting targets  and completing an agenda – it is about creating conditions for advancement in all countries, and in particular  about expanding opportunities for developing countries through their more effective inclusion in the trading  system.", "paragraph_len": 760}
{"id": 12, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 2, "text": "Focusing particularly on this last point, the Report examines how the Doha negotiations and work programme  can contribute to more effective and intensified engagement by developing countries in the WTO, building  on new opportunities generated by policy change in both developed and developing countries. The Report  divides its analysis into segments dealing with market access questions, policies aimed at facilitating openness  for development, policies for managing openness within the WTO rules, and issues relating to the possible  expansion of the WTO’s negotiating agenda. In each instance, the Report identifies basic issues and assesses  options in terms of their implications for development.", "paragraph_len": 704}
{"id": 13, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 3, "text": "I shall allow the Report to speak for itself. But I wish to make two key points. First, strong and renewed  political commitment is required if we are to give effect to the promise of Doha. Success in moving forward  effectively on the Doha Agenda will generate new economic opportunities, boost business confidence, and  send an important political message of support for multilateral cooperation aimed at restoring health and  stability to the world economy. Failure to advance will deny us all these things and dent credibility.", "paragraph_len": 531}
{"id": 14, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 4, "text": "Second, as governments formulate their positions in respect of the many issues on the Doha Agenda requiring  decision, an important point to keep in mind is that the effective pursuit of national interests requires joint  action around shared objectives. That means joint responsibility for an effective process of give and take.  Countries hardly ever obtain everything they want in negotiations, but it is deeply fallacious to see an outcome  yielding no result as a better option than one that might require hard work and patience, but offers something  to all parties.", "paragraph_len": 572}

Among the areas covered by the  negotiations or the work programme are market access in manufactures, agriculture and services, certain  rules (including anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures, and regional arrangements), trade and  environment, trade-related intellectual property rights, the relationship between trade and investment, the  interaction between trade and competition policy, transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation,  and dispute settlement. Developing countries were particularly instrumental in putting certain issues on the  agenda, including trade and technology transfer, trade, debt and finance, small economies, implementation  issues (mostly pending from the Uruguay Round) and special and differential treatment.

Some of the reasons for this are that, in the case of developed countries, MFN duties on many  products are already at zero.

The  first of these is an application of the theory of the “second-best”. In a world where policy-imposed barriers to  trade exist, and it is impossible to remove them across-the-board, it may still make sense in terms of national  and global well-being to reduce these barriers on a selective basis. If some countries are unwilling to liberalize  while others wish to do so, for example, liberalization via a regional agreement might be more beneficial to  the world than the  status quo . The brief discussion below of trade creation and trade diversion illustrates why  discriminatory liberalization could also make the world worse off, even if those undertaking the liberalization  are better off. It could be argued that the willingness of a country to liberalize should not depend on whether  others will do the same, since the gains from additional trade would accrue to the liberalizing country anyhow.

Second, governments may wish to  go deeper in integrating their economies than seems possible in a multilateral framework. They may prefer  to remove all trade barriers rather than just reducing some. Or they may want to negotiate agreements on a  range of other issues not touched upon or fully dealt with in the WTO, such as investment, competition, trade  in services, or environment and labour standards. There may be gains from deeper integration unattainable  in the WTO, including harmonization of economic policies or regulations, that is feasible among similar or  like-minded countries.

A particular reason why  some developing countries may be seeking trade agreements with their larger developed country partners  is that they are losing the preferential access to those markets previously enjoyed under developing country  preference schemes (e.g. exclusion from GSP) or because the developed country is negotiating preferential  agreements with other developing countries. Reciprocal regional trade agreements provide a means of  maintaining preferential conditions of access, and this can be particularly important if some of the countries  with which they are competing to supply the markets in question have not yet been “graduated” out of non- reciprocal preferential access arrangements or benefit from preferential treatment as a result of a RTA.", "paragraph_len": 1285}

As far as the remaining one third of tariff lines is concerned,  since many ASEAN countries have also autonomously reduced their tariffs in the 1990s, the difference  between MFN and CEPT rates is small.

Consumers pay a lower price than before  the preference was introduced, but the government loses tariff revenue. In any case, consumers pay a  higher price than they could have paid for their imports had liberalization occurred at the multilateral  level. Trade diversion occurs when the difference in production costs between the lowest-cost member  and the lowest-cost non-member is lower than the tariff rate faced by non-member countries.

A firm located in the region, albeit inefficient,  will be able to overcome the competition from a more efficient firm located in a non-member state  because it will benefit from preferential rates. Preferential rates act as a form of protection against non- members. Therefore, it is likely that an inefficient firm will lobby against the prospect of future global  liberalization, because it will not want to forgo its privileged access to the regional market. Moreover,  its lobbying power (as measured by the amount that a firm is willing to pay for lobbying) is likely to be  higher after the formation of the RTA than before the regional agreement.

Second, the more scientists and engineers, the more ideas are discovered or  created. It follows that a large community should be expected to have a larger stock of knowledge than  a small community.

By  the same token, knowledge of family planning techniques reduces fertility and increases growth, given that  knowledge changes behaviour. From the R&D side, common knowledge of technologies – for example how a  computer works – can be used by all producers of computers once the innovation has been made. Obviously  reproducing what has already been invented is less costly than inventing the product. New innovations create  new investment opportunities while the prospect of capitalizing on new inventions motivates further R&D.  Capital investment and R&D thus feed on each other in much the same way as investment in human and  physical capital feed on each other.

The share of scientists and engineers  in total employment has risen three-fold in the United States since 1950, and similar figures are found in other  OECD countries. The average number of years of schooling has increased substantially during the same period.  Yet the trend rate of productivity growth has been stable (Jones 1995; 2002). These findings indicate that, at  least during this period, the discovery of past ideas has not made current research more productive. That does  not necessarily mean that the same will apply in the future. It has been argued that knowledge and technology  move forward in leaps. Sometimes a new discovery leads to a significant technological breakthrough followed  by a large number of complementary innovations. So-called general purpose technologies are examples of  this. General purpose technologies are characterized by their usefulness in a wide range of sectors in ways  that drastically change modes of operation.

The direct impact of the tropical climate on development goes through agriculture and health.  While tropical conditions were favourable to agriculture in the very early history of mankind, the invention of  heavy ploughs, systems of crop rotation and the introduction of new crops favoured temperate zones. Tropical  diseases are found to have both a direct and an indirect impact on development. They represent higher  health risks, and consequently a lower stock of human capital. Furthermore, the demographic transformation  towards lower mortality and fertility rates has been slower in tropical areas due to higher health risks. This  transformation is part of the development process towards sustained growth.   The suggested linkage from  climate to institutions is that the prevalence of tropical diseases prevented Europeans from settling, but not  from exploiting, the natural resources in tropical areas.

An education system directed to develop a “culture of entrepreneurship” is more likely to lead to success  in developing and marketing a new product.

There is some empirical evidence that technology transfer is greater in those  industries in which the technological gap is smaller. One explanation for this is that when the technology gap  is small, the domestic producers can build on already acquired knowledge to imitate foreign affiliates. Kokko,  Tansini and Zejan (1996) use plant level data for Uruguay over the period 1988-1990 to test the existence  of spillovers within industries. They find spillovers only for plants in industries with small technology gaps  vis-à-vis foreign firms. They interpret this as meaning that the ability of the domestic economy to generate  knowledge spillovers from FDI requires the knowledge in foreign affiliates to be close to the technology  frontier of the domestic economy. Finally, the entrepreneurial environment, and other conditions in the host  country, including the intellectual property regime determine how easily a country learns and adapts a foreign  technology to the local market. Technology transfer will take place if local managers have an incentive to  invest in learning a foreign technology.

Even if  a country lowers its trade barriers, outsiders may be reluctant to trade with the country if they do not believe  contracts can be enforced or are not sure whether payments will be made. Countries with a better track  record in such matters are likely to trade more. On the other hand, openness may also have a positive effect  on the quality of institutions. Lower trade barriers may, for example, increase the incentives for individuals  and governments to improve the formal and informal rules governing commercial interactions in order to  induce more trade. Trade in itself can increase the knowledge and understanding of foreign institutions and  potentially lead to institutional reform.  Empirical research confirms two-way causality, with institutional  quality having a positive effect on openness and openness having a positive impact on institutional quality  (Rodrik et al, 2002).

There does, however, seem to be agreement that democracy may  prevent the worst outcomes, even if it does not guarantee the best ones.  In particular, it has been shown that  democracies have been successful in avoiding famines, a very acute form of poverty. A second important claim  for democracy is that there have been no wars between democracies.  It has often been argued that greater  openness leads to more democracy. Higher levels of openness imply more frequent contacts with individuals in  other countries, and thus more intensive information flows with the outside world. Such interaction arguably  makes it more difficult for oppressive regimes to maintain power. Empirical evidence confirms the existence  of a positive link between openness and democracy. Hamilton (2002) uses the Freedom House Democracy  Index to measure the “level of democracy” of countries and uses two alternative measures for economic  openness: the simple mean tariff average and the change in shares of trade in GNP. He finds a positive and  significant correlation between both measures of openness and democracy. Milner and Kubota (2001) argue  that democracy leads to more openness. They find empirical evidence that democracy and democratisation  have contributed to the lowering of trade barriers in a number of developing countries since the 1970s: i.e.  causality goes from more democracy to increased openness.

These include regulatory institutions, institutions for macroeconomic stabilization, institutions for social  insurance and institutions for conflict management.  The question has been raised whether it is not advisable  to have (some of) these institutions in place before opening up markets. In effect, increased openness may call  for accompanying domestic institutional reforms, in the absence of which a liberalizing country may encounter  difficulties in reaping the benefits of increased trade. Greater openness, for example, may imply increased  exposure to external risk, and consequently greater demand for social insurance.

A number of explanations were provided for this including long-term  productivity growth in agriculture that, because of unlimited supplies of labour, were captured by consumers  (Lewis, 1954) as well as differences in the income elasticity of demand for agricultural products and raw  materials (Singer, 1950). Whatever the explanation, the prediction was of a continuing decline in primary  product prices, with the implication that international trade would result in poor countries becoming trapped  in commodity production.

Manufacturing increased as a proportion of GDP and manufactured  exports from all developing countries increased. This was the easy stage of import substitution although  it is important to note that we cannot attribute all the economic changes that took place to the pursuit  of this policy. However, by the 1970s it became apparent that the initial success could not be sustained as  economic distortions took their toll and economic growth stagnated. The first problem was a persistent  current account deficit due to the overvalued exchange rate. A second and closely related symptom that  something was seriously wrong was the underutilization of existing capital and lack of employment growth,  even in countries where capital was scarce. Due to balance of payments problems and the rationing measures  needed to tackle them, industries could not import the necessary intermediate inputs and production could  not run at full capacity. A further problem was that productivity growth was meagre and even negative in  many import substituting industries. Infant industries often had difficulty growing up as the protection they  enjoyed reduced incentives to learn and upgrade technology, in ways that would increase productivity and  render firms competitive.

Furthermore, it has been argued that New Zealand’s comparative advantage in resource-based  activities have impeded its ability to diversify into more innovative manufacturing and service activities. Other  important reasons may include New Zealand’s small size and geographic isolation from major markets,  limiting the ability of its firms to exploit economies of scale and to export; insufficient private involvement in  innovative activity, including investment in R&D;  the high cost of capital possibly due to inadequate national  saving; and a monetary policy that some think has been too rigid.", "paragraph_len": 1462}

Trade liberalization  is beneficial because it allows countries to specialize in activities in which they are more competitive.

In practice, this implies that some people lose their job in the aftermath of trade liberalization.

According to a recent study, price elasticities in open economies have to be  much higher than empirically observed elasticities in order for trade liberalization to be self-financing.

Assessments have been performed on, among others, the Uruguay Round Agreements, the European  Union single market, the North American Free Trade Agreement and a number of bilateral free trade  arrangements involving the US and the European Communities. Canada, the United States and the  European Communities have required environmental assessments of certain trade agreements and are  now using these frameworks to review various scenarios of current WTO negotiations. The growth of  the literature reflects the greater attention paid by the trade community to environmental matters and  its willingness to respond to these concerns. The success of trade liberalization initiatives in the 1990s, in  an era of greater national and international awareness of environmental and sustainable development  issues, contributed to the increased demand for environmental objectives to be taken into account in  trade negotiations.

The second step is to evaluate the likely economic,  environmental or social consequences. By environmental impacts, what is usually meant are the effects  on the quality of air, water, land, and on biodiversity. The third step will involve identifying specific  sectors or issues to focus on (scoping) and the use of various tools (e.g. economic models, case studies)  to derive specific impacts. This is complemented by the conduct of a legal analysis of the possible  regulatory impact of the trade agreement. The basic question is whether the trade agreement requires  changes to environmental measures of the country or limits its ability to develop and implement  environmental regulations. The final element is the design of mitigation or flanking measures to limit  potential adverse environmental consequences of the agreement. This may entail changes in the  negotiating position of the country or the enactment of complementary measures after the agreement  is implemented.

First, there are severe data limitations on environmental indicators. Good environmental statistics at the  national level, and more importantly at the local or regional level, are lacking. Second, few quantitative  tools have been used in the assessments contributing to a lack of rigour in the process despite the rapid  development of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models incorporating economy-environment  interactions in recent years. They could be deployed in the scoping exercise or made more useful by  incorporating regional or local conditions. Third, the theoretical framework underpinning trade and  environment is still being developed; the empirical evidence for many of the hypothesized links is often  inconclusive. The difficulty is far more severe in the case of the relationship between trade and sustainable  development since a rigorous definition of the concept remains elusive. Finally, most of the frameworks  fail to include cost-benefit analyses, making it difficult to undertake an integrated assessment of the  economic, social and environmental impacts and to know upon what basis decisions would ultimately  be made. The presumption that mitigation or flanking measures would be put in place does not provide  sufficient justification for such an omission. Mitigation measures may not always be feasible, or they  may be too costly; or they may be unable to completely offset the negative environmental or social  impacts.  Environmental impact assessment frameworks require improvement in a number of important  areas – in modelling trade and environmental linkages, in the collection of environmental data, in the  use of quantitative methods and in the valuation of environment resources. These improvements are  essential in order to arrive at precise, robust and relevant assessments regarding the environmental  impacts of multilateral trade agreements.", "paragraph_len": 2102}

In a world of greater economic inter-dependence, the policy stance of one country becomes a more  direct matter of concern to other countries.

The WTO now has 146 and another 27 are seeking to join. Chart IIB.1 shows the evolution of  GATT/WTO membership over time. Increased membership in recent years has been accounted for entirely  by developing countries and countries in transition. A fundamental challenge for the multilateral trading  system is how to manage the growing diversity in economic characteristics, needs and priorities implicit in  this expansion of membership. The viability of the system requires that this diversity be managed to ensure  that all parties believe they are better off within the system than outside it.

In the Kennedy Round, a mild foray was made into rule-making in the area  of anti-dumping. The Tokyo Round (1973-1979) built on the beginnings of this rule-making trend, but for the  most part the non-tariff measure agreements struck at this time elaborated existing GATT provisions rather  than extending them into new policy areas.

Indeed, many governments, especially in developing  and transition economies, have undertaken significant trade liberalization programmes with no recourse or  reference to the WTO. Given the time and money required for effective participation in the WTO, the fact that  governments rarely obtain quite what they want, and that they have plenty of scope for autonomous action,  why do they engage?

No rule in the WTO requires that  Members make reciprocal commitments to open their markets to trading partners, but reciprocity, or at  least some degree of reciprocity, is an article of faith in negotiations.  Many commentators have criticized  insistence on reciprocity as mercantilist and poorly reasoned because the greatest beneficiaries of liberalization  are most likely to be the liberalizing countries themselves.

More importantly perhaps, in a political economy sense  governments will find it easier to persuade domestic interest groups to go along with trade liberalization,  notwithstanding adjustment costs, if they can demonstrate that their trading partners are engaged in a  comparable exercise. Under a reciprocal scenario, domestic export industries will reap advantages at the  same time as import-competing industries face new competition from abroad.

The costs of production and of doing business across frontiers can be  greatly reduced through co-operative arrangements that produce more harmonized approaches in such areas as  standards and technical regulations, or where governments agree to accept one another’s conformity assessment  procedures aimed at ensuring that standards are being met. Similarly, uniform administrative procedures associated  with trade can lower costs and increase the scope for profitable trade. Some may argue that costs of transactions  across frontiers could be lowered through a system of mutual recognition which over time would likely lead to  greater uniformity through “regulatory competition“.  This may be so, but mutual recognition would also need to  be negotiated at some level, and experience suggests that in many circumstances governments will prefer explicit  understandings and commitments in regulatory matters.

A willingness to pre-commit on the characteristics of a policy regime in this manner means that arbitrariness or  unrelated elements of conditionality and discrimination are removed from the picture. The dispute settlement  system in the WTO also plays an important role in this context, since it allows governments to seek recourse in  circumstances where they believe a trading partner has failed to respect its obligations.

These rates are called concessions, which are granted to each Member of the WTO on a most favoured  nation basis. They are not necessarily the same rates that are applied at customs points, which are called MFN  applied rates. They also differ from preferential rates applied on a reciprocal basis such as in regional trading  agreements, or non-reciprocal schemes such as the Generalised System of Preferences. This distinction between  bound and applied rates is important in the context of discussing the role of the WTO as an institution since, as  will be shown below, in some cases the gap between the bound and the applied rates is such that negotiations  could conclude without any meaningful change in market access. Furthermore, the principle of binding tariffs at  the WTO has both a legal and economic value. In the legal sense a binding is a concession, which a Member has  granted to other Members. In the economic sense a binding of a tariff – that is, the commitment not to raise  tariffs above a certain level – is of value since it promotes stability and certainty in a tariff regime.", "paragraph_len": 1335}

Both indicators reveal that tariffs remain an  important issue if the objective of the system is duty-free trade (Chart IIB.2). At one extreme are WTO Members  which are completely duty-free such as: Hong Kong, China; Macao, China and Singapore. At the other extreme  are a number of predominantly developing countries. It is important to note that except where all imports are  duty-free, no exact correspondence can be expected to exist between the share of tariff lines that are duty- free and the share of imports that enter a country duty-free. Duty-free tariff lines may attract a proportionately  greater share of trade than lines bearing a positive duty rate, or vice-versa.

Global labour migration numbered about 120 million people in 1996, or 2.3 per  cent of the world population, and Mode 4 movements represent just a small fraction of this group.  A survey by Pricewaterhouse Coopers looked at intra-company movements in 1997 and 2000 and  found that there was almost a doubling of the number of movements in that period (OECD, 2002c).  Important reasons for the sharp increase are globalization of production and the need to be able to  move key personnel for shorter periods in order to support foreign production, marketing, sales, after- sales services and maintenance. In the current services negotiations, both developed and developing countries have demonstrated  strong interest in Mode 4 liberalization. In general, developed countries have put more emphasis on  Mode 3 related movements, while developing countries have shown greater interest in movements  independent of the establishment of commercial presence. Over the past decade, Mode 4 has become  more widespread due to local shortages of skills in both developed and developing countries, and the  proliferation of global business networks. Local skills shortages can be filled by migrant workers - nurses  and ICT staff are prominent examples of this. However, labour market conditions change rapidly as we  have seen in the ICT sectors of late. Therefore, one major challenge for the ongoing negotiations may  be to reconcile the permanency of GATS commitments with rapidly changing labour market conditions  and the flexibility required by technical and organizational changes in the business environment.

The  sector's role in the economy can be summarized in terms of five functions: facilitating the trading, hedging,  diversification and pooling of risk; allocating resources; monitoring managers and exerting corporate control;  mobilizing savings; and facilitating the exchange of goods and services (Levine, 1997).", "paragraph_len": 648}

Case studies and cross-sectional econometric  analysis surveyed by Levine (2001) find that the presence of foreign banks exerts competitive pressure on local  banks and that there is a significant decline in their overhead costs following the entry of foreign banks. In  addition, foreign banks often bring new products and may stimulate improvements in domestic supervision  and regulation.

Furthermore, the study finds that  foreign banks have higher net interest margins and overhead than local banks in low-income countries (except  in Africa). The gains from liberalization in poor countries thus depend on the extent to which liberalization  expands the financial market and on the quality of financial sector regulation. Finally, in the financial service  sector trade liberalization may increase the exposure to risks related to external shocks and to exchange rate  volatility. For these reasons in developing countries with less well-developed financial sectors, poor prudential  provisions, and non-market arrangements such as administrative credit rationing and interest rate controls,  setting the regulatory framework right is likely to be as important a step as fostering competition from foreign  suppliers, and perhaps one that should precede the latter.", "paragraph_len": 1617}

Warren (2000)  has estimated the impact of liberalization on telecommunications penetration as measured by the number of  mobile and fixed lines per 100 inhabitants. The estimates controlled for other variables, most notably the level of  income and population density. He found that the impact of opening to new entrants (domestic or foreign) in the  domestic fixed line market had little effect on the penetration rate in countries that already had universal services,  although opening did improve the quality of the service (Trewin, 2000).

However, doubling the distance of sea transport only leads to a 20 per cent increase in transport cost. This  indicates that there are substantial fixed costs related to infrastructure, port handling, customs clearance etc. that  are at least as important as the physical distance between (potential) trading partners (Clark et al., 2001). Clark  et al. find that being among the 25 per cent least effective ports is equivalent to being 60 per cent further away  from the nearest major market, compared to being in the   percentile.

In response to Haberler, GATT Contracting  Parties established three committees to develop a co-ordinated Programme of Action Directed Towards an  Expansion of International Trade.

The move towards a more neutral stance in respect of trade  policy incentives implied opening up more to import competition as well as removing the policy bias against  exports. From the institutional perspective, Part IV already presaged this second aspect of the trade and  development debate in GATT, which was to focus increasingly on developing countries’ own trade policies as  well as market access for their exports.

First, developing countries agreed to limited market access commitments and  relatively few tariff bindings. Second, the “Code approach” was adopted in respect of the new non-tariff  measure agreements, meaning that the agreements only applied to signatories.

The Enabling Clause also restated the principle of non-reciprocity, as first spelled  out in Part IV, and further stated that developing countries expected their capacity to make contributions or  negotiate commitments to improve with the progressive development of their economies and improvement in  their trade situation.

The problem with both these positions, which tended to inform a good deal  of the debate during the post-Tokyo Round years, is that they over-simplified reality by failing to distinguish  adequately among the dozens of developing countries in the system who faced very different situations  and had very different needs.

By the end of this period in 1995, when the Uruguay Round was completed, developing countries  had assumed a much higher level of commitments within the system than ever before. A number of factors  explain this trend. First, some developing countries had enjoyed rapid growth and had succeeded in diversifying  their economies, particularly in Asia and to some degree in Latin America. This made them better equipped  to participate more fully in the trading system and changed the nature of their interests in international  negotiations. Second, the decade of the 1980s opened with a significant realignment in economic thinking in  some major economies, especially the United States. This approach, while not always pursued consistently in  the trade policy field by the large trading nations, nevertheless militated against government intervention and  emphasized the role of markets, including for development.", "paragraph_len": 1043}

Some governments  felt it was time for the GATT to tackle agriculture, something it had failed to do for the forty years of its  existence. Similar sentiments applied in the case of textiles and clothing.

One concerns the difficulty some developing countries  are encountering as they seek to implement their obligations, bearing in mind the costs, administrative  aspects and human capital requirements of implementation. Efforts are being made to address this aspect  of implementation through augmented technical assistance and capacity building efforts.

It appears that while some countries have been able to make good use of preferences at particular points in  their development, schemes like the GSP have been of limited utility to most developing countries in terms  of expanding their exports.  Among the explanations that have been offered for this situation are supply- side constraints in developing countries, administrative complexities attached to the schemes, and a lack of  stability in schemes that are essentially voluntary in nature and sometimes discriminatory among potential  beneficiaries. Additional factors are that schemes like the GSP are subject to “graduation” criteria defined by  the importing countries and are eroded over time through MFN liberalization. To the extent that preferences  have proved useful, there is always an additional risk that beneficiary countries may have specialized in areas  where they do not possess comparative advantage. The erosion and eventual elimination of preference  margins in these circumstances may imply adjustment costs and a need to reallocate resources. The above  considerations suggest that while preferences may promote development in some circumstances, they may  not be as useful as contractually based non-discriminatory liberalization, and should in any case be subject to  careful assessment before too much negotiating effort is invested in seeking preferential access.", "paragraph_len": 1505}

These provisions vary a good deal in their potential impact and it is impossible to generalize as to their  adequacy or utility. Similarly, category (iii) provisions, which offer greater flexibility to developing countries in  terms of commitments and actions, span ten different WTO agreements and are some 50 in number. Again,  the extent to which such provisions serve development objectives in developing countries can only be assessed  in relation to the individual measures concerned and the capacity of individual developing countries to take  advantage of them. Category (iv) provisions allow developing countries longer time-frames within which  to comply with their obligations. All of the 19 phase-in provisions of this nature relate to Uruguay Round  agreements. In some cases, extensions of phase-in periods are envisaged. Implementation delays are intended  to provide developing countries with extra time to develop institutional and human capacity to meet new  obligations, as well as additional economic adjustment time to meet new policy conditions.

At  the same time, developed countries have been unwilling to consider some of the more far-reaching proposals  on how to improve S&D provisions outside a negotiating context.

For some, this simply  means that individual developing countries must enjoy the necessary flexibility to apply measures and exercise  rights so that their involvement in the multilateral trading system responds fully to their trade, financial  and development needs. But others are concerned that variable geometry will accord advantages to some  developing countries at the expense of others. Clearly, the fewer Members that have access to S&D, or more  precisely, the lower the per capita income levels of qualifying beneficiaries, the more far-reaching will be  the provisions. The greater the differences in obligation levels, the more likely it is that countries will feel  that exemptions for others are prejudicial to their own interests. Therein lies the challenge of achieving a  balance that responds to the demonstrable needs of every Member. In light of these considerations, it is not  surprising that a good deal of discussion has focused on which countries should enjoy access to S&D, and  how much S&D individual countries should enjoy, rather than on the principle of flexibility. In other words, if  WTO provisions are to be tailor-made to respond to different priorities and needs among the membership,  this implies a flexibility that distinguishes not just between developed and developing countries, but among  developing countries.

For political reasons, if not economic ones, this situation is unlikely to change.  An effective approach, therefore, would seem to require greater reliance on systematic analysis rooted firmly  in developmental considerations. If it is true that “one size does not fit all”, it follows that we require a frame  of reference to define the content of S&D provisions and identify those Members for whom access to such  measures is essential. The latter aspect of identifying appropriate S&D might be assisted by efforts to define  provisions in a manner that automatically determines access thresholds for individual Members. This would  also help avoid what many potential beneficiaries of S&D fear, which is that in trying to link S&D as closely  as possible to particular development needs, an unwelcome element of discretionary decision-making could  become part of the WTO approach in this area. An additional factor to bear in mind is that while individual  Members may be reluctant to acknowledge explicitly a change in their development status, in practice it is  not difficult to trace reduced recourse to S&D provisions in various developing countries over time. An implicit  approach has the advantage of recognizing the evolutionary nature of the development process.", "paragraph_len": 1420}

In other words, S&D provisions should not define a permanent distinction among Members in terms  of their WTO obligations, but only a temporary one. Special and differential treatment provisions should,  therefore, be limited to phase-in periods. One problem with specified time periods is that they are a blunt  criterion applied to a large number of countries facing quite different conditions. A uniform approach in  the face of diversity creates contention. Moreover, even if that were not a problem, it is no easy matter to  determine an appropriate phase-in period to match development needs. Mention has already been made  of provisions that intrinsically define the beneficiaries of S&D through thresholds linked to a development  benchmark. Provisions designed in this manner make any discussion of limited phase-in periods unnecessary.  They also imply that if countries develop successfully, the same rules will fit all countries.

This bifurcated approach to  rule-making was eliminated through the single undertaking at the end of the Uruguay Round. A discussion  of an “opt-in, opt-out” approach with respect to proposals on new areas of rule-making briefly took place  during preparations for the Doha Ministerial Meeting. When the Tokyo Round Codes applied, a frequently  heard concern was that selective membership of such agreements undermined the coherence of the trading  system. The question whether the Codes were fully MFN-based in terms of the obligations they imposed on  signatories was never resolved. Some developing countries were also concerned that if non-participation was  an option, agreements might be less sensitive to the interests of potential non-signatories. In other words,  the dynamic of negotiations involving the prospect of opt-out would not favour careful consideration of the  interests and needs of poorer countries. Yet these countries would one day be expected to adhere to the  agreements. Finally, treating S&D as a matter for discrete decision about participation rather than a continuing  process of engagement over time did nothing to ease the difficulty of defining the circumstances in which  countries should sign on.

The notion of “critical mass” was introduced and Members were willing to make MFN  commitments to open further their markets even though the negotiations did not involve the full membership.  To the extent that the telecoms and financial services negotiations dealt with market access, there was nothing  very innovative about the approach, since tariff negotiations based on MFN and driven by reciprocity have always  had to deal with the problem of free-riding. The final package in every tariff negotiation under the GATT/WTO  has implicitly defined a critical mass of acceptable participation. However, an important development in these  post-Uruguay Round services negotiations occurred in telecoms, where a legally binding, MFN-based “reference  paper” defining regulatory principles for major suppliers of certain services was adopted on the basis of a  judgement on acceptable critical mass. Those who did not accept the reference paper, or who accepted only  part of it are expected to revisit the matter at a later date, including in the context of a future negotiation. A  question that merits consideration is whether a similar approach might work in other rules negotiations.

During that period, it was crucial that affected countries – characterized by excess capacity and  depreciating exchange rates – were able to increase exports, even of sensitive products (e.g. steel, semi- conductors, electronics), as trading partners were bound by WTO rules and commitments and could not simply  respond with a tightening of restrictions (WTO, 2002e). For indebted countries, increased trade secures reliable  inflows of foreign exchange to service debt. A liberal trading regime is equally important in the prevention of  financial crises and excessive debt burdens. Open trade is conducive to an efficient allocation of resources, the  elimination of anti-export bias and the strengthening of the resilience of an economy to external shocks. It  helps to preserve healthy corporate balance sheets and prevent non-performing loans in the banking sector.  Financial services liberalization and the presence of foreign services providers strengthens the stability of the  financial system through a variety of factors that improve financial intermediation (Kono et al., 1998). It is also  likely to broaden the range of debt instruments with a more balanced maturity structure, reducing short-term  loans that have exacerbated financial difficulties in many countries in the past (WTO, 1999). In the longer  term, higher incomes as a consequence of trade can pave the way to a more advantageous debt structure and  improved credit ratings.", "paragraph_len": 1575}

A crunch for credit during financial crises can adversely affect  production, investment and export and import volumes by increasing costs of financing and making it more  difficult to get capital at all (WTO, 1999a). Financial turmoil and the concomitant decline in domestic demand  have a negative effect on exports by third countries, possibly undermining growth in the latter as well (WTO,  1999a). Sustained exchange rate movements triggered through capital flight can translate into changes  of relative prices and lead to a reallocation of resources between sectors (Dell'Ariccia, 1998). Production  structures can be destabilized in countries relying on a given set of price-based measures, such as tariffs,  for the protection of industries. This can increase the pressure to employ quantitative restrictions on trade.  Indebted countries may not only see their foreign-currency-denominated debt soar, but also find it harder to  attract other forms of capital. They may be faced with worsening terms of new debt if real exchange rates  depreciate. In addition, excessive external debt has to be serviced with foreign exchange that could otherwise  be used for imports.  Given the high import content of many developing countries' exports, their overall  trade performance can be severely affected (WTO, 2002f).", "paragraph_len": 1470}

A better understanding of trade, debt and finance issues may encourage coherence efforts in  a number of ways. Most notably, it may give further impetus to meaningful improvements in market access  for products of particular export interest to developing and least-developed countries – and, in particular, a  reduction of tariff escalation to allow for diversification of production – in order to help them secure adequate  foreign exchange reserves and sustainable levels of debt.", "paragraph_len": 815}

Coordination, especially with the IMF, and an assessment of the capacity  to adopt internationally accepted standards for financial systems are important in this regard (Kenen, 2001;   Wijnholds et al., 2001). At the same time, financial sector liberalization ensures competition as well as the  transfer of skills, technology and management techniques needed to achieve higher efficiency, lower costs of  financial transactions and a wider choice of financial instruments (WTO, 1998;  WTO, 1999a).

As a new, but related coherence matter, for which the  appropriate institutional mechanisms still need to be found, it may be useful to consider appropriate means of  securing short-term trade-financing in exceptional circumstances, such as the Asian financial crisis, when it is  difficult to gain access to traditional financing instruments for export, such as letters of credit (WTO, 2002g;   Stephens, 1998).", "paragraph_len": 1015}

Even by setting prices in low-income markets close  to marginal costs, a pharmaceutical company can still earn a contribution towards its R&D and other fixed costs.  However, in order for pharmaceutical companies to engage in differential pricing, markets need to be effectively  segmented. Otherwise, there would be a substantial risk that medicines are re-imported into high-income  countries in what is known as “parallel trade“. Such a system would also depend on a willingness on the part of  the consumers and tax payers in such countries not to seek the low prices (WHO and WTO Secretariats, 2001).

Many areas of knowledge are involved, including cultural expressions,  such as folklore. An active debate on all aspects of traditional knowledge and folklore is going on at WIPO.  Some developing countries have nevertheless pressed for a parallel discussion in the WTO. Much of the  attention at the WTO is currently directed towards genetic resources preserved and managed over time by  traditional communities and the biotechnological inventions derived therefrom by third parties. If its invention  qualifies under patentability criteria, the owner of a biotechnological invention can enjoy patent protection  pursuant to TRIPS, provided it does not fall under the permissible exclusion for plant and animal inventions  other than micro-organisms and microbiological processes.

In their view, governments could require the conclusion of contracts  to require informed consent and adequate benefit-sharing arrangements prior to providing access to genetic  resources and related traditional knowledge.

Instead of moving to a more protectionist  situation when concessions are suspended, compensation would restore the overall situation to that which  existed before a violation occurred, or perhaps even improve upon it. Compensation could take a financial  form, and proposals along these lines have been made in the current negotiations.  The DSU expresses  a preference for compensation over suspension of concessions, but notes that compensation is voluntary.  So far, compensation has never been a remedy. Part of the reason may be that trade compensation would  have to be given consistently with the most-favoured nation rule (Charnovitz, 2001a). However, by providing  greater market access opportunities to all countries, the level of “nullification or impairment” suffered by the  complaining party that needs to be compensated is likely to be exceeded, and consequently, an element of  punishment would be introduced (Horn et al., 1999b).", "paragraph_len": 1116}

Bearing in mind the difficulties that would likely arise in  enforcing compensation, the only alternative to a suspension of concessions would appear to be curtailment  of the WTO rights of a defendant (Charnovitz, 2001a; Pauwelyn, 2000). Apart from these rather academic  reflections, the proposal has been made in the DSU negotiations that countries unable to obtain compensation  and disinclined to exercise their right to suspend concessions should be in a position to transfer this right to  another interested Member. In exchange, a benefit, possibly a cash payment, would be negotiated not higher  than the authorized level of suspension. While the third country who may have an interest in affording  protection to its own industry would acquire the full award, it presumably would pay for it at a discount.  Making retaliatory rights tradeable in such a manner may leave a developing country better off with an inflow  of cash, which, albeit nominally lower, would nonetheless be superior to the reduced net benefit or even loss  the country would incur by raising trade barriers and inflicting harm upon its own economy.", "paragraph_len": 1498}

Contingent measures might go  further than necessary to address the situation at hand. They might be poorly designed and entail avoidable costs.

Predatory pricing behaviour involves a monopolistic strategy to price output below  cost in the short-term in order to eliminate potential or actual competition. Once the monopolist has secured  a market, monopolistic pricing is introduced, implying super profits for the producer and welfare losses for  the economy. Critics of anti-dumping have argued that predation is a phenomenon very rarely encountered  in international markets because of the difficulty of controlling entry into a market when many actual and  potential competitors exist in many different countries and where the policy environment is less certain.", "paragraph_len": 869}

Dumping is defined as sales below  normal value, which is the difference between the export price of a good and its price in the ordinary course  of trade in the domestic market. Although dumping, however defined, is a practice of firms, the argument is  that this price differential is made possible because for one reason or another firms that dump are not subject  to the full force of competition in their domestic markets. Government actions that could give rise to dumping  opportunities include tariffs and other trade barriers, subsidies of one sort or another, regulations that stifle  competition, and the absence of effective means to control collusive or monopolistic private sector practices.  To the extent that such factors are responsible for prices below competitive levels, international negotiations to  address them would be a better approach than restricting trade. Such negotiations would require a significant  degree of co-operation among governments.

This  cannot be entirely true, since the injury test would not exist were it not for concern about consumer welfare.  Nevertheless, to the extent that anti-dumping rules do not incorporate explicit consideration of the trade-off  between producer benefits and consumer costs, import restrictions will likely serve the former interest without  clear knowledge of how much consumers pay and what the welfare calculus is for the economy as a whole.

Anti-dumping is contrasted with safeguards in this context, since the latter measures  are not predicated on any notion of unfair trade, but rather on an economic and political choice, where  governments are required to take direct responsibility for imposing restrictions on trade.", "paragraph_len": 650}

One is that the possibility exists of  taking an economy-wide view of anti-dumping, and establishing a clear picture of who wins and who loses  from such actions. Such an approach would be very unlikely to lead to the elimination of all anti-dumping  actions, but it would help to ensure that the benefits of liberalization are not unnecessarily dissipated. Another  point to bear in mind is that countries not only take anti-dumping actions of their own if they so choose – they  are also subject to such action taken by their trading partners. This argues for a balanced approach to the issue  that does not overlook consumer and export interests while seeking to avoid unjustified and costly damage to  producer interests. Some developing countries have been arguing for increases in the current thresholds below  which exports will be exempted from anti-dumping actions. Such arrangements are clearly advantageous for  developing countries with limited export potential. Finally, to the extent that anti-dumping actions are driven  by policies of other governments that interfere with the conditions of competition and lead to unjustifiably low  import prices, a question to ask is how much scope exists for addressing such policies directly.", "paragraph_len": 1551}

In these circumstances a subsidy will compensate for what otherwise would be an inadequate  investment in the future. An additional argument which is related concerns the absorption and diffusion  of new technologies. These are arguments essentially about increasing productivity and growth through  diversification into new activities. Much of this literature is couched in terms of production subsidies and  not export subsidies.

It is  clear that such products would be considered “like“ for the purposes of Articles I and III, GATT 1994. But it  is not evident whether a discrimination between such products for environmental reasons would qualify for  an exception under Article  and, especially, how it could be ascertained whether or not such regulations  were put in place for protectionist purposes (Charnovitz, 2001b). This question is key for developing countries,  as they fear that their products may be excluded from developed country markets on the grounds that their  production processes are considered comparatively more harmful to the environment than the ones used by  producers operating in developed country markets. Given that the environmental impact of such production  may be locally confined, developing countries argue that the relative abundance of environmental resources  in their countries form part of their comparative advantage and that the attempt to exclude their products,  besides being economically inefficient, amounts to an extra-jurisdictional imposition of developed country  environmental standards. Where the production of an identical good in a developing country contributes  relatively more to a trans-boundary or global environmental problem than production in a developed country,  it has been argued that financial and technological support may be more appropriate than trade restrictions  to address the problem. The environmental consequences of such assistance are likely to be more positive  than punitive action, insofar as the support, contrary to trade sanctions, promotes development and increases  resources for environmental protection (Shahin, 1999).", "paragraph_len": 1885}

A host of voluntary labelling initiatives are offered by the private sector as marketing tools to  advertise positive environmental characteristics. It remains unclear to what extent governments could be held  responsible under WTO rules for private sector initiatives that conform to the fundamental market principles of  consumer sovereignty and the right to information, but which, if promoted by dominant players in the market,  may have a significant impact on developing country trade (Okubo, 1999; Rege, 1994).

Unlike  national environmental policy measures, which a government may revoke if it so chooses, an MEA creates  obligations of similar standing to WTO obligations (Marceau, 2001). At Doha, Members agreed to clarify the  legal relationship between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in MEAs. The negotiations are, however,  confined to the applicability of existing WTO rules among parties to an MEA. Although most MEAs contain  provisions for dispute resolution, two parties, who are also WTO Members, may opt to pursue a trade-related  matter of dispute under either the MEA or the WTO or both, as witnessed in the recent case on swordfish  between Chile and the EU.  In addition, certain MEAs require parties to apply trade measures against non- parties. If both are WTO Members, the MEA non-party also retains the possibility of bringing a dispute to  the WTO. While several trade measures in MEAs may be inconsistent with the non-discrimination principle,  it may still be possible to gain permission for their application under Article XX. This could be the case, for  instance, if discrimination against like products between parties and non-parties to an MEA were found to  be justifiable on the grounds of differing conditions prevailing in the two sets of countries – related, say, to  toxic waste handling facilities. Pursuant to the shrimp-turtle ruling by the Appellate Body, the will to resolve  an environmental problem through the conclusion of an MEA, or good faith efforts to negotiate with the  non-party concerned (WTO, 2002i) may also help tip the balance for the defending WTO Member.", "paragraph_len": 1809}

Four reasons for engagement were spelled out. The first related to the economic and political  advantages of reciprocal action at the international level. The second concerned the advantage of international  co-ordination as a means of reducing transaction costs associated with trade. The third dealt with the benefits  of greater policy certainty arising from international agreements and pre-commitment to a set of principles  and rules for the conduct of business.

This reasoning may well apply to investment and  competition, but only in the context of that prior question about the welfare gains from international engagement.  Let us consider investment first. Are there advantages to the national economy from allowing foreign investment  in the same way as there are for allowing trade? Trade and investment can potentially be substitutable means of  accessing a foreign market (Markusen, 2002a, b; UNCTAD 1996; WTO, 1996). This line of reasoning takes one  in the direction of concluding that co-operation through binding international agreements is desirable, and that  the question is essentially one of content and architecture. A case against this conclusion would have to turn on  other factors not so far mentioned, such as the pre-existence of bilateral co-operation arrangements that might  be considered preferable, or the notion that this area of negotiation did not represent a priority because of scarce  negotiating resources and the costs of negotiation.

Moreover, the issue is not  limited to questions of market access:  practices such as international cartels undermine the benefits that  should flow from trade liberalization not only with respect to access to markets but in terms of the lowering of  prices and expansion of output. As with the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the role of international  agreements in this area is to help countries do what in any case may be in their own self-interest, such as the  adoption of well-crafted measures to deal with cartels and monopolies that are economically inefficient and  undermine their development prospects, but which may be difficult to do for political-economic reasons.

The average annual growth rate  of FDI between 1991 and 2000 was estimated to be 20.8 per cent, whereas the rates for GDP and merchandise  exports were, respectively, only 4.4 and 9.6 per cent (World Bank, 2002). This growth in importance of FDI  has also been accompanied by a number of structural changes in its volume and composition. FDI in services  is becoming increasingly more important (Mallampally and Zimny, 2000). Furthermore, South-South FDI flows  have increased dramatically since 1995. In 1994 they were less than   billion. After peaking in 1998 at    billion they are estimated to be approximately  billion in 2001 (Aykut and Ratha, 2002).", "paragraph_len": 950}

Between 1991 and 2001, 95 per cent of the regulatory changes affecting FDI were implemented to favour  FDI flows (UNCTAD, 2002b). Another indicator of the importance that developing countries place on the role  of FDI in development is their eagerness to attract FDI. The policy changes that favour FDI are an important  element of a positive framework for investment. To complement these policies many national governments  offer fiscal and financial incentives (Subrahmanyan, 2002).", "paragraph_len": 806}

Foreign investment in general, and FDI in particular, is a way of transferring to host countries needed  capital as well as other assets, such as technology, managerial skills, and improved access to export markets  for host countries. The enhanced mobility of FDI has the potential to contribute to the development process  in ways similar to the effect of import competition and exports. It improves efficiency, has the potential to  stimulate growth and provides a mechanism for the transfer and diffusion of technology. As with the case  of openness to trade, as discussed in Section IIA, special cases and exceptions to the general conclusion can  also be identified (Hanson, 2001; UNCTAD, 1999). Of particular concern is the impact on the stability and  position of the balance-of-payments position, especially in developing countries.

Many national governments have also been active in encouraging FDI flows through the use of various types  of financial and fiscal incentives.

Competition policy is in many ways a natural complement to the reduction of tariff barriers and to some  extent non-tariff barriers. Both encourage an environment where firms operate in such a way as to deliver  consumers the benefit of a larger variety of goods at a lower price. Competition policy may also be seen as  a governance mechanism that can help to ensure that the intended benefits of trade liberalization are not  circumvented by cartels, monopolies and other anti-competitive conduct. A related consideration is that anti- competitive behaviour often has cross-border dimensions, whereas the mandate of national competition  authorities, where they exist, is to apply remedies that have the objective of addressing the interests of those  within their jurisdiction. For these reasons, it is important to assess the extent to which co-operation within  a multilateral framework on competition policy could better ensure that the benefits of trade liberalization  (i.e., lower prices and supply expansion) flow through to consumers, and could otherwise contribute to the  development prospects of poor countries by promoting appropriate approaches to governance in a market  economy.", "paragraph_len": 1405}

First, reference has been made to the  growing body of empirical evidence that documents the harm caused by anti-competitive practices with an  international dimension (particularly international cartels) to countries that lack the appropriate tools to deal  with such practices.  The view has also been expressed that enhanced international co-operation is vital to  addressing this impact, since the conduct involved often originates outside the borders of the jurisdictions  affected. The argument has also been made that, although the adoption of a well-crafted national competition  policy should normally be in the self-interest of all countries, developing countries may suffer, for political- economy reasons, from an under-investment in competition policy institutions relative to the harm caused to  them by anti-competitive practices.

Moreover, adherence to these principles is widely viewed as  being central to the sound application of competition law and policy at the national level.

For example, Article 40  of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) recognizes the authority of  Members to take measures against anti-competitive practices relating to the licensing of intellectual property  rights. In addition, it enables Members to seek consultations with other Members in circumstances where the  requesting Member believes that its laws are being infringed by the licensing practices of a foreign intellectual  property right owner. The Reference Paper on regulatory principles, which was adopted by a number of  the WTO's Members as an outcome of the Negotiations on Basic Telecommunications Services that were  concluded in 1997, commits those Members to adopt measures to prevent anti-competitive practices by major  suppliers in this sector. Article 11:3 of the Agreement on Safeguards prohibits Members from encouraging  or supporting the adoption of non-governmental measures equivalent to voluntary export restraints, orderly  marketing arrangements or other governmental arrangements prohibited under this Article. The existence of  these and other provisions suggests that competition policy considerations cannot be excluded altogether  from the multilateral trading system; the question is whether they will be integrated into the relevant  agreements in a systematic or a piecemeal manner. A possible downside of a piecemeal approach is that  sectoral initiatives might be implemented in isolation, perhaps limited to areas where only the more powerful  Members or producer interests are effectively represented, and not benefit from the greater coherence,  discipline and exposure to cross-sectoral experience which are often cited as potential advantages of more  horizontal approaches to competition policy.", "paragraph_len": 1975}

Several of these cartels – for example, in  lysine, vitamins, and graphite electrodes – were worldwide in reach. Twenty four of these cartels lasted four  or more years, suggesting that market forces alone cannot be guaranteed to undermine these international  conspiracies (Evenett, Levenstein and Suslow, 2001). Although estimates vary, prices tend to fall between 20  to 40 per cent after international cartels are broken up (Levenstein and Suslow, 2001).", "paragraph_len": 627}
{"id": 891, "page_idx": 213, "paragraph_idx": 3, "text": "The overcharges caused by these cartels run into the billions of dollars annually. Some indication of this is given  by the magnitude of the fines imposed in Europe and the United States, which are based in part on estimates  of the amount that a cartel overcharges its customers. Since 1993 fines imposed by American authorities  on members of international cartels have exceeded   billion. Last year, the European Commission fined  international cartel members over a billion euros. Recently, the overcharges on vitamins trade during the ten  year global conspiracy involving these products were conservatively estimated to be  billion, a substantial  amount for a single international cartel. Moreover, there is evidence that this cartel deliberately raised prices by  more in jurisdictions without active cartel enforcement regimes (Clarke and Evenett, 2003.) Finally, evidence  from 12 private international cartels suggests that between 1995-2000, developing countries imported  between   billion of goods that were subject to higher prices due to international cartels (Evenett and  Ferrarini, 2002).", "paragraph_len": 1107}
{"id": 892, "page_idx": 213, "paragraph_idx": 4, "text": "The damage done by private international cartels may reinforce the case for national enforcement measures,  but does it provide a case for international collective action? Specifically, is there an argument for having some  minimum standards for national cartel enforcement? Two arguments, borne out in the enforcement experience  of the 1990s, suggest that this may well be case. First, public announcements in one nation about cartel  enforcement actions tend to trigger investigations by trading partners. For example, the Republic of Korea  began investigating the graphite electrodes cartel after reading about American enforcement actions against this  cartel. Trading partners therefore benefit from active enforcement abroad – and these benefits are likely to be  reinforced over time as formal and informal co-operation between competition authorities deepens.", "paragraph_len": 869}
{"id": 893, "page_idx": 213, "paragraph_idx": 5, "text": "The second argument is based on the fact that prosecuting an international cartel almost always requires securing  testimony and documentation about the nature, extent, and organization of the conspiracy. To the extent that  an international cartel hides such documentation in a jurisdiction that cannot or will not cooperate with foreign  investigations into the cartel’s activities, this jurisdiction’s actions have adverse effects on their trading partners’  interests. The key point is that when a nation does not rigorously enforce its cartel laws then the damage done  is rarely confined to its own borders. An international accord on the enactment and enforcement of cartel laws  can go some way to eliminating safe havens for domestic as well as international cartels.", "paragraph_len": 776}
{"id": 894, "page_idx": 213, "paragraph_idx": 6, "text": "Some are concerned about the cost of enforcing national anti-cartel laws. This concern might be  more  pressing were it not for the fact that countries at every stage of development have found it advantageous to  prosecute cartels in recent years. Indeed, 12 developing economies reported in submissions to the OECD’s  Global Fora on Competition that they have prosecuted 28 cartels during the 1990s. Interestingly, six of these  cartels involved bid-rigging; that is, deliberate attempts to defraud the state. Furthermore, the reduction in  overcharges on a single international cartel in nations where the threat of cartel enforcement activity was  higher accounted for a large proportion of many of these nations’ state outlays on their entire competition  enforcement regimes (Clarke and Evenett, 2003). This suggests that the total benefits of cartel enforcement  are likely to exceed any implementation costs.", "paragraph_len": 915}

More specifically, a WTO  agreement could incorporate a clear statement that hard core cartels were prohibited. The exact contours of  a definition of hard core cartels could only be determined through negotiations. In regard to penalties, while  these were inherently a matter for domestic law and were closely linked to the domestic legal system, an  eventual  WTO competition policy committee (if such comes into being) could provide guidance to countries  wanting to introduce penalties in terms of identifying what had proved effective in various jurisdictions.", "paragraph_len": 870}

In the more specific sense that has been used in relevant contributions of Members to  the WTO Working Group, co-operation has two main elements: (i) provisions to facilitate case-specific co- operation on anti-competitive practices having an impact on international trade; and (ii) provisions relating to  general exchanges of information and experiences and joint analysis of global trade-related competition issues  as might be conducted, for example, by a possible WTO committee on competition policy.", "paragraph_len": 1060}

Joint responsibility does  not mean undifferentiated responsibility, however, and some countries are better placed than others to make  a difference. This proposition is implicit in much of the analysis contained in the Report. The WTR also argues  that if negotiating positions are not firmly rooted in a clear and coherent framework defined in terms of the  national interest, opportunities to use the system to promote development will be missed. This means that  negotiated outcomes should not give rise to the assumption by some countries of involuntary commitments.  It also means countries should recognize that a reluctance or refusal to negotiate any commitments is a non- neutral policy stance that is bound to carry consequences in terms of lost opportunity.", "paragraph_len": 966}
