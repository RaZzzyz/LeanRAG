{"id": 5, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 2, "text": "The World Trade Report is a new annual publication produced by the WTO Secretariat. Each year, the WTR  will explore trends in world trade and highlight important issues in the world trading system. In addition  to monitoring and interpreting trade developments, the Report seeks to deepen public understanding  of pressing policy issues. The WTR does not pretend to provide comprehensive answers to complex and  many-sided questions subject to continuing debate among governments and their constituencies. Rather, by  explaining the origin of issues and offering an analytical framework within which to address them, the WTR  aims to contribute to more informed discussion and a better appreciation of the options available to address  policy challenges.", "paragraph_len": 755}
{"id": 6, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 3, "text": "Following a report on trends in world trade over the previous year and some observations about prospects  for the current year, WTR 2003 takes up three issues of topical interest in international trade. These are  developments in South-South trade, trends in non-oil commodity markets, and the growth of regional  trade agreements. In each case the Report analyses developments over the last few years, highlights their  implications, and draws a number of conclusions about the options facing governments.", "paragraph_len": 506}
{"id": 7, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 4, "text": "In the case of South-South trade, we see a marked expansionary trend, but one that is rather narrowly based  in regional terms. South-South trade clearly holds dynamic potential that could be realized more effectively  through further trade liberalization. This conclusion should in no way dilute focus on the need for continuing  liberalization efforts in respect of North-South trade, nor should it understate the need to develop the  necessary infrastructure and policy climate to facilitate South-South trade.", "paragraph_len": 513}
{"id": 8, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 5, "text": "The Report’s analysis of trends in non-oil commodity markets highlights the well-known fact that developing  countries economically reliant on basic commodities have suffered in recent years from price declines and  continuing volatility. A range of solutions are on offer to address this problem, but some of them have proven  less than effective in the past. Fresh thinking is needed, both on the question of what can be done in respect  of the commodity markets themselves, and how developing countries might diversify their economies away  from excessive reliance on a narrow production base. Trade liberalization has a role to play, particularly in the  areas of agriculture and tariff escalation.", "paragraph_len": 702}
{"id": 9, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 6, "text": "Regional trade agreements have burgeoned in the last decade or so. This can be good news and bad news.  Such agreements are good news when they bring regions closer together, create new profitable trading  opportunities and set the scene for more inclusive market-opening. They are bad news when they discriminate  unduly against third parties and frustrate the attainment of multilateral objectives built on non-discrimination.  No government has challenged the view that the multilateral trading system must retain its primary unifying  role at the core of trade relations among nations. Given this unity of purpose, governments need to do more  to ensure the coherence and compatibility of regional trading arrangements with the multilateral trading  system. This implies a strong commitment to advancing the multilateral agenda as well as ensuring that  regional agreements are designed to support and not to compete with the WTO system.", "paragraph_len": 941}
{"id": 10, "page_idx": 2, "paragraph_idx": 7, "text": "The second section of the WTR addresses a broad range of issues that are of immediate and vital interest to  the membership of the WTO. This year’s theme is trade and development. Starting from a broad although  brief discussion of development and the relationship between trade and development, the Report goes on  to analyse how the Doha Development Agenda can contribute to growth and development in developing  countries.", "paragraph_len": 425}
{"id": 11, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 1, "text": "The Director-General of the WTO would never declare any year unimportant or unchallenging for the  trading system. But some years are undoubtedly more momentous than others, and this is one of them.  The Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancún in September is not the end of the Doha negotiations, but a very  important landmark on the road to completion. At Cancún, Ministers will have to take stock of progress in the  negotiations, provide political guidance and take certain decisions. This is not simply about meeting targets  and completing an agenda – it is about creating conditions for advancement in all countries, and in particular  about expanding opportunities for developing countries through their more effective inclusion in the trading  system.", "paragraph_len": 760}
{"id": 12, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 2, "text": "Focusing particularly on this last point, the Report examines how the Doha negotiations and work programme  can contribute to more effective and intensified engagement by developing countries in the WTO, building  on new opportunities generated by policy change in both developed and developing countries. The Report  divides its analysis into segments dealing with market access questions, policies aimed at facilitating openness  for development, policies for managing openness within the WTO rules, and issues relating to the possible  expansion of the WTO’s negotiating agenda. In each instance, the Report identifies basic issues and assesses  options in terms of their implications for development.", "paragraph_len": 704}
{"id": 13, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 3, "text": "I shall allow the Report to speak for itself. But I wish to make two key points. First, strong and renewed  political commitment is required if we are to give effect to the promise of Doha. Success in moving forward  effectively on the Doha Agenda will generate new economic opportunities, boost business confidence, and  send an important political message of support for multilateral cooperation aimed at restoring health and  stability to the world economy. Failure to advance will deny us all these things and dent credibility.", "paragraph_len": 531}
{"id": 14, "page_idx": 3, "paragraph_idx": 4, "text": "Second, as governments formulate their positions in respect of the many issues on the Doha Agenda requiring  decision, an important point to keep in mind is that the effective pursuit of national interests requires joint  action around shared objectives. That means joint responsibility for an effective process of give and take.  Countries hardly ever obtain everything they want in negotiations, but it is deeply fallacious to see an outcome  yielding no result as a better option than one that might require hard work and patience, but offers something  to all parties.", "paragraph_len": 572}

Among the areas covered by the  negotiations or the work programme are market access in manufactures, agriculture and services, certain  rules (including anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures, and regional arrangements), trade and  environment, trade-related intellectual property rights, the relationship between trade and investment, the  interaction between trade and competition policy, transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation,  and dispute settlement. Developing countries were particularly instrumental in putting certain issues on the  agenda, including trade and technology transfer, trade, debt and finance, small economies, implementation  issues (mostly pending from the Uruguay Round) and special and differential treatment.

Some of the reasons for this are that, in the case of developed countries, MFN duties on many  products are already at zero.

If “one size does not fit all”, how should differentiated needs be  accommodated by appropriately differentiated provisions without imparting excessive discretion, either to  those who have access to S&D or those who make those access decisions?  One way of trying to ensure  relevance is to design provisions that intrinsically define beneficiaries, through such means as thresholds or  triggers.", "paragraph_len": 1188}

Many ingredients go into effective technical assistance and capacity building, and the scope  of the WTO’s contribution is circumscribed by its functions and competence. The WTO’s efforts are focused on  human capital development. This essentially concerns the acquisition of knowledge about international trade  and the trading system, combined with the technical skills to identify, articulate and defend national interests  in the field of trade. Other agencies and governments provide similar support in this area. Some of them are  also engaged in other aspects of assistance and capacity building, such as providing physical infrastructure and  support in other areas of economic policy. The joint provision of support makes coherence among agencies  and governments involved essential for effectiveness.", "paragraph_len": 927}
