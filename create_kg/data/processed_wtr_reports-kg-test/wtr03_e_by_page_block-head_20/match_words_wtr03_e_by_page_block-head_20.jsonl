The WTR does not pretend to provide comprehensive answers to complex and  many-sided questions subject to continuing debate among governments and their constituencies.

Such agreements are good news when they bring regions closer together, create new profitable trading  opportunities and set the scene for more inclusive market-opening. They are bad news when they discriminate  unduly against third parties and frustrate the attainment of multilateral objectives built on non-discrimination.  No government has challenged the view that the multilateral trading system must retain its primary unifying  role at the core of trade relations among nations. Given this unity of purpose, governments need to do more  to ensure the coherence and compatibility of regional trading arrangements with the multilateral trading  system.
